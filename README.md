## Description <a name="program-description"></a>
This is a user-friendly browser-based game of Tic Tac Toe, created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
The game features a responsive design that will adjust according to screen size and orientation. 
It contains elements that can be customised by the user, 2 game modes and JavaScript logic to allow players to play against the PC. 
This is a simple yet fun application.

The game has the following features:

- The ability to edit displayed user names (2 player mode only).
- Logic that allows a player to play against the CPU, The CPU determines a likely winning combination and tries to stop the user from making that combination. The CPU has a 60% chance of making a definite blocking a winning move (making it move human, as 100% made it nearly impossible to win)
